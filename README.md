# Friend visualiser

This file just visualises your facebook data.

Just download your data from Facebook (there are guides online) - in your files you'll be able to access something called friends.html. Copy and paste whatever's in there into
a text file.

Pull this file, go to the directory with your data saved, and type `python readFriends.py <yourfile>.txt`


It'll save a copy automatically to the directory your data is in.
